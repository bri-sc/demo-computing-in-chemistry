## Computing in Chemistry Demo
This is a Bristol Scientific Computing (BriSC) Python interactive demonstration that showcases how Chemistry can be applied in a computing context. This provides a taster for the type of coding and approach we take on the "Chemistry with Computing" and "Scientific Computing with Data Science" programmes at the University of Bristol. See the [BriSC webpage](https://brisc.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/) and [Postgraduate Programme for Scientific Computing with Data Science](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/msc-scientific-computing-with-data-science/) for more details.

As this demo is Chemistry-themed, this assumes some knowledge of A-level Chemistry but no knowledge of computing is required. This demonstrates how we can use code to investigate experimental data.

Click on the icon to launch the demo through MyBinder:

Note: this may take a while to load as MyBinder is building a coding environment for you to use in the cloud. This will not save any changes made to the file and will timeout after a few minutes of inactivity but can be relaunched.

The Jupyter notebook uses data sourced and modified slightly from:
